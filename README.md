Another very simple calculator that takes the equaton F=MA and solves for all three variables. 
Unlike my [Coulomb Calculator](https://github.com/SethMazer/CoulombCalculator) their are seperate indivual tabs to solve for each variable of the equation.
(Previous calculator was only set it up to solve for one variable, Force)

The three tabs are Force, Mass and Acceleration. The force tab uses F = MA, to solve for Force, the mass tab uses M = F/A to solve for Mass, and
the acceleration tab uses A = F/M to solve for acceleration. Force is assumed to be in Newtons, Mass is assumed Kilograms, and Acceleration is assumed to be in M/s/s. 
The calculator will solve using the given values to solve for those units in their assumed units, I.e A = (15)/(3) will be represented as "5 M/s/s"

**Needs Physics.PNG in same directory as the script, else if you dont want the custom icon delete lines 16-17 in the script. This is Only if you are downloading the raw code, zip works fine*
